# Extended Matrix Solution (EMS-TIE)
GPU-optimized iterative phase retrieval method based on the TIE, called Extended Matrix Solution to the TIE (EMS-TIE)

This project contains the Python implementation of the EMS-TIE phase retrieval method, and it also compares this method with other state-of-the-art techniques. Python implementations of all these methods are provided.

In the `data/` folder, you will find the data used for simulations and experiments. 
In the `notebook/` folder, you will find the notebooks of simulations and experiments.

## Recommendations

- It is strongly recommended to run this on *Google Colab*
- In general, two images are used to estimate the axial derivative.
- Do not forget to modify the `path_repo` variable when using the notebooks.
- If you use this repository, please do not forget to cite our work as mentioned above.

## Instructions

To use the notebooks:
- We recommend downloading the code as a zip file.
- Unzip the content.
- Upload the folder to Google Drive, maintaining the folder structure.
- IMPORTANT: Modify the `path_repo` variable.

After that, you can execute the notebooks. Don't forget the recommendations mentioned earlier.
